Why use two's compliment?
Two's compliment representation of signed binary integers reduces the complexity of the ALU (arithmetic logic circuit) required to perform basic math on binary integers in comparison to other representations like one's complement. One's complement has two values that represent zero for an 8-bit number it would be 00000000 and 11111111. 11111111 is refered to as negative zero in one's compliment. Any operation that carries past the max or min limit of a one's compliment number must have a end-around carry or borrow, while a two's compliment will be correct without any change. (Both require an overflow flag). The two's compliment can also store one extra value (for an 8-bit integer it can be -128).
